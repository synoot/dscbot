# Status

This branch (v2, third rewrite...) is almost completely functional.
The internals have been rewritten - I doubt it's much faster, but the internals are cleaner and easier to edit.
More changes are planned to come, but for now it won't be merged as it isn't 100% complete yet.

# Updated Roadmap

- [ ] **Remove all built-in commands**
- [ ] **Add more module functionality**
- [ ] **Add more modules in general**
- [ ] **Set up a site for configuration**
