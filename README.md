# Discord Bot v2

Another rewrite. This will likely become the main branch in the future.

## Planned additions:

* Discord.js-ify code (use native classes)
* Streamline index.ts (it doesn't need to be as long as it is)
* Less source files (seriously, I don't need six of them)
* Clean up command structure (a singular module.exports)
* Remove libraries such as require-dir (if I have my own libraries in my source, I have more control over what it does)
* Optimize and document code (more of a learning resource)
* REALLY async-ify my code (async is so much nicer to work with!)
* Clean up file structure, outside of /src (I also need to optimize my save space!)
